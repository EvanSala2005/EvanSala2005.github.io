<p style="color:White;text-align:center">Iâ€™m Samoan and I look like I play football, but don't know a thing about it. I play a lot of chess, poker, and billiards.</p>
<p style="color:White;text-align:center">I took this class because I want to do this kind of stuff for a living. Because I believe that programming and coding is the future.</p>
